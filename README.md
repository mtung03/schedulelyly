## Welcome to the Pearson Vue internship challenge

This exercise is designed to help you demonstrate some basic knowledge of Ruby On Rails and should
take between 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on your familiarity with Ruby on Rails and basic Rails
configuration.

#### Tasks for this assignment

* Clone the project
* Update the configuration to work with your Rails installation (this example uses 4.2.5)
* Create and Seed the database with our default data
* Fix an initial bug when running the application (View past reservations should display old reservations)
* Add the ability for a person to schedule a future exam
* Add a 'Score' column to the Reservations Table and add scores to past exams
* Create a pull request with us so we can review your changes

#### Notes
- No need to add user login or authentication 
- Styling would be nice, but not required
- Once completed make sure to submit a pull request before coming in for our on site interview;
you will lead a presentation of your work with our developers
